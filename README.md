# Goals App

This is an application which is my playground for designing the full-stack Node.js application.

## Purpose:

This application is responsible for:

* Defining quantifiable, smart goals which needs to be daily tracked.
* It creates aesthically pleasing charts & summaries based on the data.
* It creates time-based summaries according to inputted data.
* (Optional) It sends reports to an user - in a form of e-mail, push notifications & other means.
* (Optional) It allows to auto-upload data from variety of devices - at least from my phone (iPhone 6S), my girlfriends phone (OneNote Plus 2) & smart watches (Withings Steel HR & Withings Steel).
* (Optional) It allows you to create projects from the set of tracked goals.

## What technologies are being field-tested here?

* [d3.js](https://d3js.org/) - for generating charts & other data visualisations.
* [Express](http://expressjs.com/) - I have no prior (big) experience with Express so I want to base my backend solution on it.
* ... more?

## Other technologies
* [React.js](https://facebook.github.io/react/) - library for creating frontend views from user-defined components.
* [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/) - library for routing in SPA apps.
* [Ramda](http://ramdajs.com/) - standard library replacement in a functional flavor.
* [Redux](http://redux.js.org/) - state management for SPA apps
* ... more?
